            <h2>The Idea</h2>
            <p>This website was inspired by the show Bob's Burgers. There was no specific reason for choosing this show as inspiration. The <a href="./bobs-netflix.html"><span class="red">Watch</span></a>, <a href="./bobs-apply.html"><span class="red">Apply</span></a>, and <a href="./bobs-analysis.html"><span class="red">Analysis</span></a> page take aesthetic inspiration from Netflix&mdash;the only difference is everything is Bob's Burgers&ndash;themed.</p>
            <p>The search bar on the <a href="./bobs-netflix.html"><span class="red">Watch</span></a> page  is supposed to suggest that this site is dedicated to videos of Bob's restaurant and, perhaps, his cooking videos. The <a href="./bobs-apply.html"><span class="red">Apply</span></a> page pushes this idea further by asking the user to apply to work at his restaurant. It asks primarily trivial questions that are derived from the show's content, and the submit button pretty much suggests that anybody and everybody gets hired at Bob's Burgers&mdash;even children are allowed to work there. Originally, the IRS' website was chosen by chance as inspiration for the <a href="./bobs-irs.html"><span class="red">Pay Taxes</span></a> page. However, it fits the theme because if you work at Bob's Burgers, you're getting paid&mdash;hopefully, even though Bob Belcher is broke&mdash;and have to pay taxes. The Bob's <a href="./bobs-merchandise.html"><span class="red">Merchandise</span></a> page was definitely inspired by the Google Shopping page by chance.</p>
            <p>An important idea expressed by this page is the idea of privacy and what is or isn&rsquo;t private information on the Internet. First, on the <a href="./bobs-netflix.html"><span class="red">Watch</span></a> page the user realizes all his or her prior searches are being kept track of. Then the user is asked to provide personal information in order to <a href="./bobs-apply.html"><span class="red">Apply</span></a> for a job at Bob's Burgers, which is also being kept track of. The information from the <a href="./bobs-apply.html"><span class="red">Apply</span></a> page is used to tailor <a href="./bobs-merchandise.html"><span class="red">Merchandise</span></a> suggestions specific to each user, based on his or her selctions on the previous page. Finally, all the user's information is reflected on the <a href="./bobs-irs.html"><span class="red">Pay Taxes</span></a> page, hopefully, prompting the user to realize he or she should be more aware of his or her privacy on the Internet.</p>
